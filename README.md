The code imports the necessary modules from React and a CSS file.

useState is a React hook used to manage state within a component.
useRef is another React hook used to create a reference to a DOM element.
The App function is the main component of the application.

Inside the App component, two useRef hooks are used to create references to HTML elements:

inputRef is a reference to the input element where the user enters a number.
resultRef is a reference to a paragraph element where the current result is displayed.
The useState hook is used to create a state variable called result and its corresponding updater function setResult. The initial value of result is set to 0.

Four functions are defined within the App component:

plus: This function is called when the user clicks the "add" button. It takes the current value entered by the user, converts it to a number, and adds it to the current result value using the setResult function.
minus: This function is similar to plus, but it subtracts the entered value from the current result value.
times: This function multiplies the entered value with the current result value.
divide: This function divides the current result value by the entered value.
Two additional functions are defined:

resetInput: This function is called when the user clicks the "reset input" button. It clears the value entered by setting the inputRef value to an empty string.
resetResult: This function resets the result value to 0 when the user clicks the "reset result" button.
The return statement contains the JSX code that defines the structure and elements of the calculator UI.

The resultRef is used to display the current result value.
The inputRef is used to capture user input.
Buttons are added for each operation and the reset functions.
Regarding the issue with the buttons not working as desired, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact problem without more information. However, here are a few common reasons why the buttons may not be working:

Make sure that all button click handlers (onClick attributes) are correctly assigned to the corresponding functions (plus, minus, times, divide, resetInput, resetResult).

Check if there are any error messages in the browser's console that could indicate issues with the code.

Verify that the required dependencies (React and other related libraries) are correctly installed and up to date.

Ensure that the code is being executed within a valid React application setup, including proper rendering of the App component.
